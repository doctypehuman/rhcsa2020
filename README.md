# Welcome ! 

This respository has been made to document my attempt to obtaining the [RHCSA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa) certification. This certification is provided by Red Hat Enterprises.
Feel free to have a look at their website [here.](www.redhat.com) They offer various certifications but the one I am pursuing is considered an entry level exam aimed at people starting out their career in Information Technology.

I hope that you find the material posted here helpful.
