## Bend in the corner before the home stretch ! 

### Update
	While the date has been postponed by two weeks, 
	there needs to be some major focus on daily 
	studying and more importantly finishing the 
	syllabus.
	
	4 Chapters are pending to be completed along with 
	1 book. Once done , revision needs to be done.
	I have not even mentioned BASH yet. 

	End Of Day
