# Day 8

I have been sick for the past few days. Caught cold, but in these days of Covid even a simple cold 
has to be taken seriously. 

Luckily I was indoors all the time and there was no contact with the outside world. 

All that I had studied will have to be repracticed and the tempo has to be built up again. 

The key is to keep at it.
