# Day 26

### 20 days to go 

	The last few days have been not productive for studying since there were
	certain domistic chores that had be done. Winter is coming and one needs
	to be prepared for it. Well now that is done, it is time to soldier ahead.
	
	While I have been busy with other responsibilites, I have not altogether
	forgotten about studying. I have read up on editing files in Vim and I 
	have also read up on bash scripting. 

	While on the topic of BASH, I have managed to write a few scripts. Very basic
	but effective. They are scripts which on executing display exam objectives and
	a set of excercises that I can do daily so that i remember the commands well.

	That's all for now.
