# Additions from the terminal

Git is an important tool for collaboration. Notes from now on will be uploaded via the terminal.
This is to practice git commands on the __Terminal.__

Also, all of this done from a virtual machine running CentOS minimal.

Text Editor used is __VIM__


OK ! Additions from the terminal is faster, more fun and you get to learn [GIT](https://git-scm.com)

This will make documentation much easier.
