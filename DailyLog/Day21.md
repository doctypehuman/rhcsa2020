# Day 21
## 02-10-20
### 33 days to go

The number of days have increased since I have decided to sit for the exam on November 4th.

I have not scheduled it yet since i dont want undue pressure on myself. Considering that I have might have to travel and there can be some deviations from the study plan, I have decided on the 4th of November.

That is all that was done today. Decided the date and started making notes for bash.
