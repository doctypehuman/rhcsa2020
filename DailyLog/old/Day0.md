#DAY 0
## 30th August 2020
So, I have decided to clear the RHCSA exam. The exam consists of 19 questions that have to be answered in 150 minutes. 
The objectives of the exams have to be taken into consideration and practice is the key to clearing the exam. 


##Previous experience with Linux. 

I have always played along with Linux for a while. The fact that almost all of it is Open Source resonated well with me.
Also, the fact that one can deploy professional grade software using it got me experimenting with command line and the other aspects. 
Slowly, I introduced myself to the world of text editors, file systems and I realised I wanted more. 
This desire for learning more and the fact that I can get employed by learning this is the main motivation for me to appear for this exam.
