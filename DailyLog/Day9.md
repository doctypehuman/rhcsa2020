# Day 9 

The last entry was made 5 days ago and that was a sick note. 
I have managed to study a little bit more but not have been able to document it in git. 

Documentation has to improve. 

In other news and more important news I have registered for the exam. 

I have not yet scheduled it since I am at the begining of the course. Having said that I have decided on a tentative date for appearing for the exam. 26th October. 

Counting today, thats 37 days to go.
