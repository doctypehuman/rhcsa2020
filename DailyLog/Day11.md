# Day 11 22-09-2020

The last note was incomplete, but daily documentation has to be made into a habit.
A habit which withstands the pressure of daily life. 

Things that were covered over the last few days were as follows
- Monitor and Manage Linux Processes
- Control jobs 
- Kiling /suspend processes
- Run process in background / foreground.
